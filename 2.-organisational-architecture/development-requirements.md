# Development requirements

User journey:

* The user chooses if (s)he participates in ONE of the following capacities:
  * Contributor
  * Contributor AND Governance-participant
* Starting point = user's public address (e.g. 0x39FE3eEEDD9F986209208b85B4e5e469b5Ea318d)
  * Complemented by a Sybil attack solution such that each contributor to TBA DAO can have only one public address to participate within the governance of TBA DAO (proof of humanity? Proof of uniqueness?
* NOTE TO SELF: Github is the primary collaboration tool. To access, a contributor needs an account. How compatible is the identification in this account with the pseudonymity of the user's public address? How do both of these "identifiers" relate to each other? Do they need a connection, or can they exist independently?&#x20;
