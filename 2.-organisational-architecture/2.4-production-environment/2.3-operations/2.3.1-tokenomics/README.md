# 2.3.1 Tokenomics

n**ote to self: analyse where sourcecred finds its place (only governance contributions or also consulting mission related contributions?)**

TBA DAO issues a utility token with ticker TBA, which serves as means of payment for the services delivered to clients as well as for internal services between DAO participants.

The total and final number of utility tokens will amount to 100 million tokens and will be issued at the launch of the DAO. The 100 million tokens will be offered for purchase to 100 co-founders. Each co-founder can purchase up to a maximum of 1 million tokens in accordance with the governance constitution that determines that the cumulative holding of the utility coin by 1 legal entity can not exceed 1% of the total supply.

When a legal entity's holdings of the TBA utility coin surpass 1% of the total supply of 100 million tokens, then a choice is given to sell those tokens within 1 month or to concede those tokens to the treasury of TBA DAO.

The treasury of TBA DAO will serve as backing for the value of the utility token TBA and hold only highly liquid monetary values.
