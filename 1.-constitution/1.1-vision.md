# 1.1 Vision

TBA DAO is convinced that decentralisation can help to solve  severe socio-economic issues like concentration of economic and political power, the widening gap between rich and poor, unilateralism and individualism to just name a few.

TBA DAO believes that Public Permissionless Blockchains and Decentralised (Autonomous) Organisations introduce a novel paradigm in socio-economic participation, value creation and philosophy, that enables the transfer of decisional power and participative authority from a few centralised hierarchical organisational centers to a multitude of decentralised cooperative individuals.

TBA DAO believes that cooperative economic value creation and decentralised bottom-up governance and operational decisional power, together with the feedback signals from utility coins, has the potential to create superior products, services and work-environments.

TBA DAO is convinced that Pâ€‹ublic Permissionless Blockchains and Decentralised (Autonomous) Organisations constitute a new socio-economic transactional infrastructure which allows for ownership of ones work and collective control of organisations.&#x20;

TBA DAO believes that Public Permissionless Blockchains and DAOs enable the realisation of critical aspects that support sustainability of work and economic value creation: collective intelligence, self-adapting organisations, cooperation and multilateralism and a more direct connection between the market/the client and the value creator.

TBA DAO adheres to the idea that -as stated by Nick Hanauer- "in contrast to physics, economic laws are a matter of choice"(1) and that the DAO's constitution and its acceptance by all its  contributors might proof that economics don't need to be fatalistic unequal.\
